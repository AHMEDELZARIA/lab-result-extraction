#### **General Instructions**
1. **Preserve Original Layout**:
   - Ensure that the extracted markdown reflects the visual and semantic layout of the original PDF, including headers, sections, and bullet points.

2. **Maintain Section Order**:
   - Parse the content section by section, preserving the exact order as it appears in the PDF.

3. **Header Formatting**:
   - Use Markdown headers (`#`, `##`, `###`, etc.) to represent different sections of the document. Match header levels to font sizes or section importance.

4. **Tables**:
   - Recreate tables in the PDF using Markdown table syntax:
     ```
     | Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |
     |----------|----------|----------|
     | Value 1  | Value 2  | Value 3  |
     ```

5. **Line Breaks and Spacing**:
   - Retain line breaks and paragraph spacing as close to the original as possible. Use two spaces at the end of a line for line breaks or empty lines between paragraphs.

6. **Bold and Italicized Text**:
   - Convert bold and italicized text into Markdown equivalents:
     - **Bold**: `**text**`
     - *Italic*: `*text*`

7. **Lists**:
   - Use bullet points (`-`) for unordered lists and numbers (`1.`, `2.`, `3.`) for ordered lists.

8. **Handle Metadata**:
   - If the PDF includes metadata (e.g., creation date, author, etc.), include it at the beginning or end of the markdown file as a dedicated section.

#### **Lab Report Specific Instructions**
1. **Lab Report Header**:
   - Parse any headers or identifying information (e.g., "LabCorp", "Collection Date") as top-level headings or bold text:
     ```
     # LabCorp
     **Collection Date:** 09/08/2020
     **Collection Time:** 3:27 PM
     ```

2. **Patient Information**:
   - Use bullet points for patient details:
     ```
     ## Patient Information
     - **Name:** John Doe
     - **DOB:** 01/01/1990
     - **Gender:** Male
     - **Address:** 123 Main Street, Springfield
     ```

3. **Physician Information**:
   - Include physician details in a separate section. Make sure the field name "physician" or "ordering physician" or something similar is near the name:
     ```
     ## Physician Information
     - **Name:** Dr. Jane Smith
     - **NPI:** 1234567890
     ```
